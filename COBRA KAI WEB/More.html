        <li>Founded in 1948, the Cobra Kai was highly appreciated for its social activities, and received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Education as a “General Incorporated Association” in 1957. From then until now, we have devoted our effort to inherit and develop this irreplaceable martial arts culture born in Japan. Consequently, on 21st March, 2012, we were approved as ” Public Interest Incorporated Association” by the Prime Minister.

            The Cobra Kai aims to promote improvement of its skills and self-discipline by research and instruction of Karatedo, thereby contributing to the improvement of the well-being of the people and cultivate a sound martial arts spirit. Moreover, it aims to contribute to world peace by spreading the spirit of Japanese martial arts which respects courtesy to countries all over the world.
            
            In order to achieve these objectives, we the JKA engage in the following activities.</li><br><br>

            <li>The JKA has consistently instructed and promoted Karatedo since its establishment in 1948. From the beginning we have trained specialized instructors who have completed our own curriculums, and established a solid foundation on instruction and technique of Karatedo.

                The educational philosophy of Martial Arts trying to develop their own personality through daily hard training is getting high appraisal and trust. This Martial Art has already gained high achievements in youth education being adopted as a regular school subject.
                
                The Japan Karate Association has the best technique system and instruction system.
